var byte tmpstat  ; this contains the last sspstat value, on which the user functions are
                  ; called. i2c_hw_slave_on_error() could use this to know what happend

-- setup an i2c slave, with low address (not high addresses coded with 10-bits)
-- The passed address must be 8-bits long: it's a 7-bits address + the 8th R/W bit
--
-- A global "i2c_enable_start_stop_interrupts" constant can be defined to so
-- interrupts are generated on Start/Stop signals.
--
-- /!\ careful: calling this procedure will enable interrupts (global, peripherals and i2c)
procedure i2c_hw_slave_init(byte in height_bits_icaddress) is
   -- slave 7bit address
   SSPCON1 = 0b_0011_0110

   -- if this constant is defined and true,  enable start/stop interrupts.
   if defined(i2c_enable_start_stop_interrupts) == true then
       if i2c_enable_start_stop_interrupts == true then
           SSPCON1 = SSPCON1 | 0b_0000_1000   -- enable start/stop interrupts
       end if
   end if

    -- last 8th bits is for read/write setting.
