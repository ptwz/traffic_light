-- Description: this lib is able to handle the GP2D02 lib, reading distance 
-- measure with this IR Ranger.
-- --
-- You can either use the read procedure, or access the pseudo-variable
-- to retrieve distance measures.
-- --
-- When defining pins the ranger is connected to to, it's important to 
-- set them as "volatile" (level will go low/high within function call)
-- See sample(s) for more.
--
-- Notes: reading a distance can take quite a long time, approx. 74ms.
-- See datasheet for more, but you should remember this while using this IR ranger
